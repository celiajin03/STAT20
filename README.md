# STAT20
This repository contains my lab assignments for the course "Introduction to Statistical Programming with R". The labs are completed using R Markdown (.Rmd) files, which contain both code and written explanations.

## About the Lab
Throughout this course, students will learn how to use the statistical software, **R**, to perform data analysis and visualization. They will also learn how to interpret and communicate statistical results effectively. Each lab is designed to cover a different topic related to the use of R, including data management, simple programming, and statistical graphics, and builds on the skills and concepts covered in previous lessons. 

## Getting Started
The lab assignments are completed using the R language and RStudio IDE. 

You can download R from the [R Project](https://www.r-project.org/) website and RStudio from the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) website.
